Hamster run privacy policy.

-childrens saftey:
Hamster Run is mostly recommended for ages over 13 and people under 12 shouldnt be in the game, there is some very bad words that can be said without censoring the voice chat.
in our opinion. kids that has full allowance to play vr and is alowed to use swear words can play the game.

-data:
we only collect data for stuff like, banning and yeah thats it. 
we have to make the game a good place for everyone. 
we dont acctually use your data, but we collect it for later use in the future.

-multiplayer software.
we cant controll what the multiplayer service is doing but we use it due to how useful they are.

-conclusion.
we have now talked about the multiplayer software. the data we get from the game and the childrens saftey.
there is now nothing else we can say anymore.
